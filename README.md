This Repo is to do the basic webgl programming a second time and get this into my head a bit more.

I use the support library from [gl-matrix](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix) to do the Matrix calculations etc.

The endgoal should be a webgl Panorama view where I can put on some Photos and rotate the camera around.
